# SalmonAgeDist 
R code used to analyze the changes in the age distribution of hatchery salmon in Alaska. 

Chum_Fry_1988-2018 is an excel file with the amount of fry released each year from 1988-2018. Chum_Adults_1987-2017 is the reorganization of the returing fish by year sepereted in to two age classes,3&4 and 5&6. Using these two excel files in the Regression model produces data showing the average number of fry produced by each age class.


Chinook_Smolt_1996-2018 is an excel file with the amount of smolt released each year from 1996-2018. Chinook_Adults_1994-2016 is the reorganization of the returing fish by year sepereted in to two age classes,2-5 and 6&7. Using these two excel files in the Regression model produces data showing the average number of fry produced by each age class.

The excel files Chum_Revisions and Chinook_Revisions contain all the data we used through out our research. They include proportion graphs we computed and analyzed. These files compile the data into neat booklets to showcase the data. 


There is a powerpoint presentation available to view that outlines the framework of our research, as well as includes additional graphs that demonstrate the key conclusions of our analysis.

# Abstract for Research
Declines in salmon sizes have been reported primarily as a result of younger maturation rates. This change in age distribution poses serious threats to salmon-dependent peoples and ecological systems. We perform a statistical analysis to examine the change in age structure of spawning Alaskan chum and Chinook salmon using 30 years of hatchery data. To highlight the impacts of this change, we investigate the average number of fry/smolt that each age of spawning chum/Chinook salmon produce. Our findings demonstrate an increase in younger hatchery salmon populations returning to spawn, and fewer amounts of fry produced by younger salmon compared to older salmon. These results suggest the potential risks associated with younger spawning salmon and aim to help better understand salmon behavior in order to sustain and protect healthy salmon populations.
